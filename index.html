<h1>Hello World!!!<h1>
    <p> A data warehouse is a central repository system that collects, 
        integrates, and stores large volumes of data from various 
        sources for analysis and reporting to support business 
        intelligence and decision-making. It acts as a "single source 
        of truth" by providing historical and consistent data for 
        operations, allowing users to generate reports, monitor trends,
         and extract valuable business insights from data-driven 
         applications.
